# About Me

## Early Life

I had few friends while growing due to the constantly changing schools because of my mother's job. I have lived in Pandamatenga, Ramotswa, Ramatlabma, Selebi Phikwena and Serowe. This made it hard for me when trying to make friends however, I end up having phyiscs and technology as my companion due to my cousins' intervention. I desire to learning and accumulate as much knowledge as I possibly can and share it with people...You could say I have _the mind of a scholar_.

#### Interests ####

- Technology -it is not limited to modern techology only, things like the trebuchet also.
