## Journey
### Early Life
Back in 2009, I visited my cousin and that was when I saw a computer for the first time. I was intrigued by its fuctionality, I used to describe it as a *television that you can control*. He allowed me to play pacman, and I kept wondering how is it possible for me to control the character. However, it was until 2010, the same cousin introduced me to the laptop and I learned by programming. I do not think much about it, I thought it was something only americans can do. In 2017, I managed to learn a bit of HTML and CSS, and decided that I would fully learn how to make software because I found joy in creating something of my own.
