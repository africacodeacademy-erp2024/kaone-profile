## Journey
### Early Life
Back in 2009, I visited my cousin and that was when I saw a computer for the first time. I was intrigued by its functionality, I used to describe it as a *television that you can control*. He allowed me to play Pacman, and I kept wondering how is it possible for me to control the character. However, it was not until 2010, that the same cousin introduced me to the laptop and I learned by programming. I do not think much about it, I thought it was something only Americans can do. In 2017, I managed to learn a bit of HTML and CSS and decided that I would fully learn how to make software because I found joy in creating something of my own. 

### Education and Career
My education journey has been interesting and I learned a lot. Learning as a whole is an interesting thing for me, I have made learning my Life purpose. I have no work experience.
